		<section name="Contamination detection step">
			<p>This step assesses the sample contamination from the fastq files. To do Aozan uses the principles from 
			<a href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastq_screen/">FastQ Screen</a>. 
			FastQ Screen allows to screen a library of sequences in Fastq format against a set of sequence databases. </p>
			
			<p>The code has been rewriting in Aozan and additional values have been creating.
			There we use <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml">bowtie</a> to align reads 
			to reference genomes or contaminant databases like adapter sequences, PhiX and ribosomes databases.
			Moreover it aligns on the genome of the sample based on the data in the casava design file.
			</p>

			<p>All the reads are aligned, currently. The runtime is very long, even with the multithreading option of bowtie. 
			The list of reference genomes is reduit to the essential.
			For reduce the runtime, if necessary, all fastq files are uncrompressed in multithreading mode. 
			After, the align on reference genomes is launched. At the end, all temporary fastq files are removed. 
			This solution requires to have a lot of free space in temporary directory defined. 
			Aozan estimates the needed space and sends an warning email if it is not enough.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Configuration parameters</h4>

			<h5>General configuration for launch the mapper.</h5>
			<p>Aozan uses the development in other framework from the platform, 
			<a href="http://transcriptome.ens.fr/eoulsan">Eoulsan,</a>for management alignment automatic.
