		<section name="Welcome to Aozan">
			<p>Aozan has been developed in order to automatically handle raw data transfer, demultiplexing and
                        quality control of a sequencing run once a HiSeq or Nextseq run has been completed. This software is involved in the primary data analysis.
                       Aozan produces compressed FASTQ files and a quality report from an HiSeq or Nextseq sequencer output in order to evaluate
                        each sequencing parameter. Aozan can work on most computer infrastructures and only requires a samplesheet for each run.</p>

			<p>Aozan greatly helps to improve the efficiency in the run data management and to keep tracks of the run statistics
			through automatic mails and HTML report pages.</p>

		<section name="Supported devices">
			<p>Aozan can handle the output of many Illumina sequencer models, however not all the models of Illumina sequencers has been tested with Aozan. As Illumina sequencer outputs are very similar, Aozan may work with most of the Illumina sequencers.
                           You can <a href="mailto:aozan@biologie.ens.fr">contact us</a> to tell us if your sequencer model is compatible with Aozan.</p>

		<section name="Sample sheet validator">
			<p>We also provide a <a href="http://outils.genomique.biologie.ens.fr/samplesheetvalidator/" target="_blank">Bcl2fastq samplesheet validator</a>
			to help the users in checking their run samplesheet. This tool uses only html and javascript. <u>Not a single  data is sent</u> to our servers when you use this tool.</p>
		</section>


		<section name="What's new in Aozan?">

			<!--subsection name="New Samplesheet Validator v2"><p>
				A new samplesheet validator for is available. With its new design it can now manage samplesheet v2.
				[IMAGE] + [LINK]
				</p>
			</subsection-->

			<subsection name="Aozan can now fully be executed using a Docker image."><p>
				Aozan can now fully be executed using a Docker image. Thus you don't need to install all dependancies on your computer before using it.
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="New built-in step to automatically recompress all your fastq files."><p>
				Aozan has now a new built-in step which recompresses fastq and fastq-gzip files into fastq-bzip2 files. bzip2 files are more compressed than gzip files and thus take less disk space.
				They also are compatible with hadoop since they are chunked files. Please check <a href="recompression.html">here</a>.
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Define denied runs and prioritized runs and automatically deny runs in error"><p>
				In the aozan.var.path, you can specify [step].deny file (qc.deny, demux.deny, ...).
				Runs specified in these files won't be processed by the step.
				In the aozan.var.path, you can also specify runs.priority file.
				Runs specified in this file are processed in priority by aozan when available
				Furthermore, on detection of a run in error, automatically add it to hiseq.deny
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Easy samplesheet auto usage"><p>
				Aozan can now automatically check and use a samplesheet when available in run root folder if no samplesheet is given in input.
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="True Illumina values for metrics like phasing and prephasing"><p>
				Phasing/prephasing values are now extracted directly from Illumina InterOps binary files. Thus gives exactly the same values as sequencers.
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Choose the number of mismatch for demultiplexing"><p>
				Samplesheet can now contain the number of allowed mismatch for demultiplexing
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Aozan 2.0 manage HiSeq and NextSeq sequencers">
				<p>Aozan can manage several sequencers, and now handles the latest versions of illumina sequencers (HiSeq and NextSeq).
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="bcl2fastq 2 software management">
				<p>bcl2fastq version 2 deals with the data demultiplexing from Hiseq or either NextSeq runs.
					Aozan can manage the new sample sheet file format from bcl2fastq version 2.
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Demultiplexing using docker">
				<p>Aozan can run the demultiplexing step using a bcl2fastq 2 docker image.
					bcl2fastq 2 images are available <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/genomicpariscentre">on our dockerhub</a>.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			
						
			<subsection name="FastQC version 0.11.3">

					Aozan still contains previous Aozan enhancements to FastQC (the &quot;<b>Bad tiles</b>&quot; module
				and the optional blast in the &quot;<b>Overrepresented sequences</b>&quot; module).</p>
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection name="New projects tests in quality control report">

				       </div>
				  </p>
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection name="FastQC version 0.11.2">
				<p>Aozan now use the latest FastQC version (0.11.2) that includes two new modules:
				<ul>
					<li>&quot;<b>Per tile sequence quality</b>&quot;;</li>
					<li>&quot;<b>Adapter content</b>&quot;.</li>

					this module suggest the sample(s) and the number of reads that can be recovered using a demultiplexing step with
					one more mismatch that the number of mismatches has been used. See for more information about this feature the

			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Using Aozan in multi-servers context">
				<p>The Aozan configuration file has been improved with a new "<code>include</code>" directive. With this enhancement, it will be easier to

		        <p>Optionally, Aozan adds a sub-step in FastQC to enhance the Overrepresented sequences module. For sequences with &quot;no hit&quot;,
		           a blastn can be launch to estimate the source.
		           Blastn results with 100% identity and 0% gap will be included in report.</p>
